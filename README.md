## User Story

As a traveler

I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities

so that I can plan a trip accordingly

## User Experience
Upon page loading, a searchbar and card saying, "Enter a city into the Search bar to get today's weather" are displayed.

When the user enters a city into the searchbar and presses the search icon, that city's weather data is pulled from the openweathermap API and displayed in a div. The 5 day forecast is displayed for the same city below. The city is added to a sidebar under the searchbar so that that the weather information can be called again by the click of that city's button.
